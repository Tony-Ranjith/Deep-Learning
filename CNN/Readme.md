# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 

## About CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deep learning models designed for **image classification and pattern recognition**. 
They automatically extract features from images using convolutional layers, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Components of CNN
âœ” **Convolutional Layers** â€“ Extracts important features like edges and patterns.  
âœ” **Activation Function (ReLU)** â€“ Introduces non-linearity for better learning.  
âœ” **Pooling Layers (MaxPooling, AvgPooling)** â€“ Reduces dimensionality while retaining key information.  
âœ” **Flattening** â€“ Converts feature maps into a vector for classification.  
âœ” **Fully Connected Layers (Dense)** â€“ Makes final predictions.  

### ðŸ”¹ Why CNN for Image Classification?
âœ” **Automatically learns features** instead of manual extraction.  
âœ” **Reduces the number of parameters** compared to fully connected networks.  
âœ” **Captures spatial relationships** within images.  
âœ” **Efficient for large datasets like CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MNIST.**
